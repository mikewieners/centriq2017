# PalindromicNumber

## Requirements:

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

## Notes:
In the interest of time, I copied code from the [ARTPPalindrome](https://github.com/mikewieners/centriq2017/tree/master/ARTPPalindrome) project. I plan to combine these projects in the future.
