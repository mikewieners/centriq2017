# ARTPPalindrome

## Requirements:

### Given a string, check if it is a palindrome.

Example

For 
```C#
inputString = "aabaa"
```
The output should be
```C#
checkPalindrome(inputString) = true;
```

For 
```C#
inputString = "abac"
```
The output should be
```C#
checkPalindrome(inputString) = false;
```

For
```C#
inputString = "a"
```
The output should be
```C#
checkPalindrome(inputString) = true;
```
## Notes
This was written as a console application. A later project, [PalindromicNumber](https://github.com/mikewieners/centriq2017/tree/master/PalindromicNumber) could have used this code. I plan to combine these projects in the future.
